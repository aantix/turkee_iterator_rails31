<h1>Who We Are</h1><h3>Jim Jones ( jim.jones1@gmail.com )</h3>
<p>Creator of the Turkee gem, a Rails form library that allows a developer to easily integrate with Mechanical Turk using the standard Rails form helpers. The gem also makes it easy to retrieve the data submitted to Mechanical Turk and map those values back to your existing models.</p>
<h3>Mark Percival ( m@mdp.im )</h3>
<p>Creator of the RTurk gem, a simple wrapper and library for Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk API.</p>

<div class='slide '>
<h1>What is Mechanical Turk</h1><p>The Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is one of the suites of Amazon Web Services, a crowd-sourcing Internet marketplace that enables computer programmers (known as Requesters) to co-ordinate the use of human intelligence to perform tasks which computers are unable to do.  The people that perform these tasks are informally referred to as &#8220;Turkers&#8221;.</p>

<h1>Iterative Uses for Mechanical Turk</h1><p><strong>Exploring Iterative and Parallel Human Computation Processes</strong>
  Greg Little1, Lydia B. Chilton2, Max Goldman1, Robert C. Miller1</p>
<p><i>We are interested in human computation processes which coordinate small contributions from many humans to achieve larger goals. For example, an algorithm might coordinate many workers to write a description for an image.</i></p>

<h1>Rails Integration Turkee Gem</h1><ul>
	<li>Turkee gem
<a href="http://github.com/aantix/turkee">http://github.com/aantix/turkee</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Turkee gem builds on top of RTurk providing a simple form helper for posting/representing model data on Mechanical Turk&#8217;s external servers.</p>
<h3>The create_hit method takes a model, creates a Mechanical Turk hit pointing it at the new resource URL for the model passed in.
e.g. new_iteration_url</h3>
<pre class='code'>
task = Turkee::TurkeeTask.create_hit(host, turkee_task[:hit_title], turkee_task[:hit_description], 'Iteration',
                                     turkee_task[:hit_num_assignments], turkee_task[:hit_reward], turkee_task[:hit_lifetime])
</pre>
<h3>The form helper directs the form action towards the external Turk url and expands the fields in the given block in the same manner that Rails&#8217;s form_for helper does.</h3>
<p><img src="file:///Users/jjones/Projects/turkee_iterator_rails31_mdp/doc/presentation/turkee_form_code.png" alt="" /></p>
<pre class='code'>
&lt;form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://workersandbox.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit" class="new_survey" id="new_survey" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" id="assignmentId" name="assignmentId" value="2G2UC26DG67D103D8QB0FOK2JTAD66"/&gt;

<h1>Retrieving Data from Mechanical Turk</h1><p>The <b>process_hits</b> method retrieves the user posted data from Mechanical Turk, reconstructs the data into a param hash (like a Controller), determines the model for which the data represents, and creates an entry for that model in the database.</p>
<pre class='code'>
Turkee::TurkeeTask.process_hits(@turkee_task)
</pre>

<pre class='code'>
rake turkee:get_all_results
</pre>

<h1>Turkee Iterator (updated for Rails 3.1)</h1><p>Turkee Iterator is a demo built on top of Turkee to sample some of the capabilities of Mechanical Turk.  Allows for flexible HIT requests from Mechanical Turk.</p>

<h1>Difficult Dilemma</h1><p><b>Directions</b>:  I&#8217;m having difficulty telling my kids that Santa doesn&#8217;t really exist. On top of that, they&#8217;e been terrible this past year.</p>
<p>Please write a short letter to my kids from Santa explaining why he can no longer give them gifts anymore(any reason will do). I will transcribe the best one it and leave it in their stockings on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>

</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I am demo&#8217;ing Mechanical Turk to the Ruby SF meetup group.  Please tell send us a creative &#8220;hello&#8221; and where you&#8217;re from.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A one or two line introduction would be nice.  Tell us how the weather is in your city.  Tell us about your family.  Or just simply say hello.</li>

<h1>Prev Demos</h1><p><b>Topic</b> Is this line funny?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Directions ** I love jokes and I especially love &#8220;one liners&#8221; that you often hear in movies such as <em>Airplane!</em> or <em>The Naked Gun</em>.  Here&#8217;s a favorite of mine :</li>
	</ul><p>&#8220;Like a midget at a urinal, I was going to have to stay on my toes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Read the one-liner(s) below, and if you think it is funny, click the &#8220;vote&#8221; button.  If you do not think it is funny, submit your own one-liner for a chance to win $1.00 bonus if your one liner is selected.</p>

<h1>More Content Creation</h1></div>
<div class='slide '>
<h1>Mechanical Turk is an untapped market in terms of getting content created for your application.  Start thinking outside the context of scientific surveys and fact finding and start thinking of this resource as a pool of human workers with emotions, opinions, and stories to tell.</h1><p>E.g.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Iterative story telling where each Turker adds a piece to a never ending story.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Have the Turker give their opinion on a topic or product and then have other Turkers respond to that opinion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Have the Turker describe some emotionally happy or painful point in their life.  Ask emotionally charged question to have the Turker reveal the essence of who they are.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class='slide '>
<h1>Example: Obesity Testimonials (Design of Questions)</h1><h3>Upload a picture of yourself of when you first considered yourself &#8220;fat&#8221;.</h3>
<p><img src="file:///Users/jjones/Projects/turkee_iterator_rails31_mdp/doc/presentation/1CTODZITSLYU5LPCWR5PPSP7FG9JDO_obese_image1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><b>When the above picture was taken, were you aware that you had been gaining weight?  Describe the feeling you had when you first glanced at the picture and noticed your weight gain. Did anyone else notice or make snide comments?  How did you feel?</b></p>
<p><i>&#8220;As a child I was pretty average but I was lead to believe that I was fat.  I would request simple items, things that are status symbols to the average kid, like jeans.  These small requests would be shot down, my mother telling me that I was too big to fit into a pair of jeans.  I remember her telling me that when I was eight.  It started a cycle in my life where I felt that I was too large, too fat, for the things other children took for granted.&#8221;</i></p>

</div>
<div class='slide '>
<h1>Other Concepts</h1></div>
<div class='slide '>
<h1>Micro Bonuses</h1><p>The concept where the user is awarded a varying amount depending upon how much time they take to answer a question or how accurate it (relative to the other user answers)</p>
<p>E.g. Maybe there&#8217;s a trivia game where you record how long it takes each user to answer a question and the fastest response for the day gets 10 cents instead of 5.</p>

</div>
<div class='slide '>
<h1>Gambling</h1><p>Allow users to gamble their potential pay.</p>
<p>E.g. Sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>Show the user all of the recent headlines for a given stock, stock charts, etc.</p>
<p>You state that they can either take their payout now, OR, if they think that the stock will close out higher than it is now at the end of the day,
they can &#8220;gamble&#8221;, and will be awarded the fee PLUS a bonus at the end of the day.  If it closes down from the point at where it is, they receive nothing.</p>
<p>Does a future, larger payout increase the quality of data analysis?</p>

</div>
<div class='slide '>
<h1>Interesting Research Findings</h1></div>
<div class='slide '>
<h1>Financial Incentives and the Performance of Crowds</h1><p><b>Winter Mason, Yahoo! Research</b></p>
<p><i>Figure 2 reveals two main findings: first, that across all difficulty levels participants chose to complete more tasks on average when the pay was higher (F(3,607) = 15.73, p &lt; 0.001); and second, that across all payment levels, the number of completed tasks decreased with increasing difficulty.</i></p>
<p><i>As Figure 3 indicates, however, <b>increasing compensation did not improve accuracy</b>, which we measured in two ways&#8230;</i></p>

<h1>Task Search in a Human Computation Market</h1><ul>
		<li>Lydia B. Chilton, University of Washington **</li>
	</ul><p><i>We found strong evidence that Turkers sort by the most number of HITs available (so they can find one task, and then do 100 instances of them in a row) and the most recently posted HITS (so they get the latest and greatest HITs).</i></p></div>
